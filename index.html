							<h2>Experience</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I have over 15 years of experience in both hands-on and leadership roles in application
							development and data engineering. From a business-knowledge expert learning to write code,
							I've grown to become a director-level leader in IT at a Fortune 100 company.</p>
						<p>Throughout my career, I've worn many hats, going from a DSL-specific rules writer for IBM
							ILOG JRules to a Java server developer, to a mobile developer, a data
							engineer, and beyond. I've worked in diverse industries, including insurance and finance,
							healthcare,
							consumer apps, enterprise apps, and data.</p>
						<p>I'm proud of my ability to adapt to new technologies and take on new challenges, always
							striving to learn and grow. Whether leading teams or contributing individually, my focus
							remains on driving success for both clients and colleagues.</p>

							<h2>Philosophy</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I'm a leader, learner, communicator, and technologist. As a leader, I prioritize
							supporting and growing the people I lead. My non-traditional path to my current role has
							taught me the importance of being adaptable and embracing the unknown, making me a lifelong
							learner. As a communicator, I strive to distill our vision, mission, and values into an
							easy-to-understand paradigm, so that our goals are clear and ingrained in our culture. And
							as a technologist, I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise, exploring new
							programming languages and emerging technologies.</p>

							<h2>Education</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I graduated valedictorian of a small high school class. I was inspired to pursue a career in
							technology by my computer repair and robotics teacher. He ignited my passion for
							the field and encouraged me to major in Electrical Engineering. I enrolled at the
							University of Cincinnati, but, after attending for over two years, I realized that
							Electrical Engineering Technology was not equivalent to Electrical Engineering, and I
							couldn't afford to start over. I was the first person from my family to attend university,
							and didn't understand the difference between majors until I'd dug into the coursework.</p>
						<p>I began my career at the Cincinnati Insurance Companies as an insurance rater, where I
							learned how to manually calculate premiums for commercial insurance policies. Later, I was
							hired onto a software development team that was implementing a system to automate that math.
							Here, I was lucky enough to learn from experienced mentors, who shared their knowledge and
							guided me as the team leveraged my business expertise. I also supplemented my knowledge with
							open course work from MIT and Stanford. Though I was initially brought on as a business
							expert, I fell in love with tech and pursued it wholeheartedly.</p>
						<p>Through my experiences, I have learned that while it is possible to pursue a career in tech
							without a degree, it is a challenging path. Traditional coursework can provide a solid
							foundation and make the journey easier. Nonetheless, I am proud of the career I have built
							and the ability to learn and adapt quickly.</p>

							<h2>Personal Life</h2>
						</header>
						<p>I live in Hebron, KY with my wife and three young kids. We enjoy spending time together
							exploring new places and making memories on the open road with our RV. I love to get
							lost in a good book, particularly in the space opera or fantasy genres. When I'm not
							reading, I enjoy building and tinkering with my custom-built gaming PC, and I'm always up
							for a good
							match of League of Legends.</p>
