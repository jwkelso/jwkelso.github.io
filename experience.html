				</header>
				<p>I joined this group to bring an end-user perspective to the work that Data Services
					is doing since the data engineers and data scientists from my previous team are huge consumers of
					Data Services' offerings.
					Upon joining the group, I quickly identified the need for
					reorganization. Data Services was structured based on technology, rather than value, so I worked
					closely
					with my leaders to categorize the different types of value we produced and to create a mission
					statement for each. This led to the formation of teams aligned with each type of value, resulting in
					a more cohesive and impactful organization. To further refine our portfolio, I conducted an
					evaluation and made tough decisions on which
					products to keep and which to deprecate.</p>
				<p>I work every day to align my teams' work with the overall goals and objectives of the company,
					allocate resources to maximize impact and minimize risk, and foster strong relationships with
					stakeholders both within and outside the company. I am committed to effective communication and
					collaboration, risk management, and continuous improvement, all while mentoring and developing my
					team members to create a culture of learning and growth. Data Services is supporting massive data
					workloads across the organization, including over 1.9
					million pipeline runs and 65 thousand files transferred betweek first-, second-, and third-party
					sources and destinations, all while helping to ensure quality in our pipelines, compliance with
					privacy regulations, and fostering an ecosystem of shared data products.</p>
				<p>I am also working with a group of leaders across 84.51ยบ and Kroger to develop a joint data
					strategy for Kroger and out two organizations. The goal is to create scalable, self-service tools
					and establish federated computational governance, resulting in a product-oriented approach to data
					development and design with a focus on domain-oriented solutions.</p>

				</header>
				<p><a href="#lead-dev-8451">My previous work as a lead developer on Prism Measurement</a> led to my
					promotion to leading the group.
					Our primary focus was to curate digital advertising metrics and identify shifts in consumer shopping
					behavior resulting from advertising campaigns. I streamlined operations for high-volume data
					analysis, achieving high-fidelity campaign performance measurement for Kroger and its CPG partners.
					To enable metrics-driven decision-making, we delivered the curated metrics and consumer behavior
					shifts through compelling storytelling, leveraging business intelligence tools.</p>
				<p>To scale data operations, I played a critical role assisting the entire Prism platform adopt a data
					mesh
					approach. I collaborated with various directors, product owners, and tech leads in establishing
					subdomains
					within the platform, improving data organization and accessibility. Additionally, I managed the
					migration of our company's measurement code from a legacy SAS analytics solution to modularized
					PySpark on
					Databricks in Azure. This enabled the re-use of code to customize the measurement of campaigns and
					resulted in a streamlined process and improved efficiency.</p>
				<p>In my two-year tenure as the Director of Prism Measurement, our team achieved tremendous
					success by supporting a 10X/100X increase in revenue year over year, expanding our product
					offerings,
					and successfully migrating our measurement code to a more efficient platform. While I'm proud of
					these accomplishments, I'm especially proud of the opportunity to mentor and lead an exceptional
					group of individuals who were instrumental in our team's success. Thanks to their hard work and
					dedication, two of our team members were promoted to director-level roles, a testament to their
					talent and the culture of growth and development we fostered.</p>

				<p>This was the role that stretched me the most
					technically. My first role was as a mobile application prototyper, where I created and
					maintained prototypes for multiple mobile applications. The one that sticks out most was the work I
					did on Checkmate. Checkmate was a native mobile iPad application that simplified the testing of
					printed coupons that would be mailed out to customers. The application was well-received by testers,
					as it eliminated the need for time-consuming and error-prone manual data entry.</p>
				<p>After this, I worked on my first Angular application, Agatha Glass, which served as a prototype
					front-end for a data science-as-a-service platform. This app was backed by a Spring Boot backend
					that I also developed. From this work, I moved onto a joint application/data development team that
					was maintaining NomNom, a coupon intake tool that validated all the necessary fields describing a
					given coupon in our automated intake systems. This project was my first exposure to data
					development, and I learned to use Scala, PySpark, and Hadoop as I led the team in maintaining and
					evolving the application.</p>
				<p>Finally, I moved into the Prism Measurement space, working as a team of two with a product owner to
					develop a reporting system for coupon performance and analyzing shopping behavior shifts in our
					customers. My previous experience in data development proved to be invaluable here, as I
					put those principles to good use in building and scaling the platform. As the team grew from just
					the two of us to around 20 people, I was promoted to director of this and 2 other related teams in
					the space.</p>

				<p>Upon rejoining Cardinal Solutions as a Managing Consultant, my skills as a mobile developer had
					reached industry-leading levels thanks to <a href="#lead-dev-bp">my experience at Black Pixel</a>
					and mentoring from
					experienced organizational leaders. As a result, I was tasked with consulting on the company's
					highest-profile mobile projects and leading a team of team leaders in the practice.</p>
				<p>One of my most notable engagements during this time was working with 84.51ยบ to help them set up their
					"mobile development factory". In this role, I oversaw the entire process, including figuring out all
					the necessary elements to develop mobile applications as needed, such as security, training plans,
					and CI/CD server setup. Although my engagement with them was originally only two weeks, we expanded
					it to six months to ensure everything was set up properly. During this time, I worked closely with
					the architecture team to overcome challenges like getting a Mac mini into their data center and
					debugging low-level Cocoa framework code to figure out why their security software wasn't allowing
					the iOS simulator to run on their macs.</p>
				<p>After completing my work with 84.51ยบ, I moved to Fifth Third Bank to lead the upgrade of their mobile
					check deposit capabilities. In this role, I introduced the team to Protocol-oriented programming on
					the iOS side and re-implemented the functionality from the ground-up, fixing a host of user-reported
					bugs in the process.</p>

				<p>When I landed a role with Black Pixel, one of the elite boutique mobile development firms, I felt
					like I had "hit the big time". The company was known as one of the top places that Apple recommended
					for mobile
					app development consulting, and I was surrounded by a team of experienced rockstars who were more
					than happy to share their knowledge with me. While most of their focus was on iOS, I was one of the
					first native Android developers that they had hired. As a result, I had the unique opportunity to
					assist with the Android implementations of apps like ESPN, the NY Times, and many others. One of my
					most significant accomplishments during my time at Black Pixel was working on the redesign of the
					front page for the NY Times app. </p>
				<p>My experience with the Android platform also proved valuable to the Vice President of engineering,
					who was new to the platform. I was able to leverage my experience with both iOS and Android tooffer
					guidance on how to strategize around delivery of Android applications, and I was able to translate
					key concepts to help him understand the platform even though he was an iOS developer. Working at
					Black Pixel was a game-changing experience, and it taught me a lot about the power of collaboration
					and knowledge-sharing in the tech industry.</p>

				<p>As Cardinal Solutions began to invest in a native mobile development consulting practice, I was hired
					as their first dedicated native mobile developer. While working on mobile development projects for
					various clients, I grew the practice by taking on additional responsibilities, including serving as
					a team lead responsible for HR management of 5 consultants based in Cincinnati. Along the way, I
					convinced leadership to hire a dedicated graphic designer, helping them understand that
					user-centered design requires more than just adding "pretty pictures" at the end of a project. With
					my efforts, we grew the team to 10 developers and continued to deliver successful mobile development
					projects for clients.</p>
				<p>This experience at Cardinal was a turning point in my career as it turned me into an experienced
					software developer, with Agile principles ingrained in me. I learned how to drive projects to
					completion and became an effective team leader. One of my favorite memories at Cardinal was leading
					a team of 3 developers fresh out of college through the implementation of a "Square competitor" for
					a large payments company in Cincinnati. As I taught them the ropes of mobile development, they
					helped me understand new concepts and technologies in mobile development being taught in new
					University courses. A lot of what I learned at Cardinal shaped me into the technologist that I am
					today.</p>

				<p>While <a href="#ass-developer">working at the Cincinnati Insurance companies</a>, I purchased my
					first Android smartphone, a
					Motorola Cliq, and was immediately inspired by the possibilities it opened up for people. This
					inspired me to start developing an app to track my checkbook balance using the Android SDK (1.5). A
					graphic designer friend saw my efforts and decided to help outโrescuing me from my underdeveloped
					design sensibilities, leading to the founding of Vervv LLC and the launch of our first Android app
					in the Google Play Store.</p>
				<p>Buoyed by the success of our first app, Ledgerist, we developed our first native mobile iOS
					application, Convertr, a unit conversion app, and later ported it to the Android platform. As a side
					business, Vervv taught me a lot about running a small business, including support, finances, and
					marketing. Our hard work paid off when we were pursued by T-Mobile, Verizon, and Amazon to be
					included in their respective app stores, resulting in Convertr and Ledgerist being featured by
					Amazon as "apps of the day", with each application boasting over half a million downloads.
					Additionally, we were featured on the Google Play store and as an Apple staff pick in several
					countriesโfurther boosting those downloads and earning both applications a 4.5/5-star rating.</p>

				<p>I started my career as a business expert at the Cincinnati Insurance Companies. My

					development team because of this expertise. At the time, they believed they could teach me to "write

					learned how to write business rules using IBM ILOG JRules and became passionate about programming. I
					consumed everything I could find on the subject, mainly through openly available coursework from MIT
					and Stanford.</p>
				<p>As my skills grew, I took over ownership of maintaining all of the development tooling for the
					business rules
					development team. Eventually, I even owned the integration between the rules engine and the
					server-side systems for eCLAS BOP/DBOP. Toward the end of my tenure with the Cincinnati Insurance
					Companies, I founded my own company with a friend and began working on native mobile Android
