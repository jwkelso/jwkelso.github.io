		content="I'm a leader, learner, communicator, and technologist. As a leader, I prioritize supporting and growing the people I lead. My non-traditional path to my current role has taught me the importance of being adaptable and embracing the unknown, making me a lifelong learner. As a communicator, I strive to distill our vision, mission, and values into an easy-to-understand paradigm, so that our goals are clear and ingrained in our culture. And as a technologist, I'm always seeking to expand my knowledge and expertise, exploring new programming languages and emerging technologies. My skills include: Organizational Leadership, Conflict Resolution, Agile (Scrum, Kanban), Power BI, PySpark, Hadoop, Databricks, Azure, Tableau, Python, Java, Spring Boot, Objective-C, Cocoa, Swift, AngularJS, Scala, Android Framework, Linux, Data Mesh, and Data Fabric." />

							<h2>I am a Leader</h2>
						</header>
						<p>At the heart of my leadership philosophy is the belief that when individuals thrive, the team
							thrives, and the organization thrives. That's why I'm passionate about understanding the
							unique intersection of each team member's goals and strengths with those of the
							organization. I'm not afraid to give honest and direct feedback, but I believe that being a
							great leader means balancing constructive criticism with tangible support.</p>
						<p>Being a straight shooter isn't a license to be a jerk. It's about having the courage
							to speak truthfully and directly, while still working tirelessly to support and empower my
							team. Whether it's jumping in to help with a tricky problem or simply offering words of
							encouragement, I'm always looking for ways to supplement opportunity areas and lean into
							people's strengths.</p>
						<p>At the end of the day, my goal is always the same: to create a culture of growth,
							transparency, and shared success. When every team member is empowered to achieve their
							full potential, everyone wins.</p>

							<h2>I am a Learner</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Throughout my career in technology, I've observed that one of the most valuable traits a
							person can have is the ability to adapt and learn quickly. As someone who came into the
							industry through a non-traditional path, I know firsthand the importance of being open to
							new experiences and embracing the unknown. My journey began with two years of Electrical
							Engineering Technology at the University of Cincinnati, but as the first person in my family
							attending university, I soon realized that I was in the wrong program for what I wanted to
							do. Unable to afford starting over, I dropped out and went to work as an insurance rater for
							an insurance company.</p>
						<p>It wasn't long, however, before I was given an opportunity to learn to code. I was hired onto
							a software team trying to automate the work I was doing, and they saw my deep business
							knowledge as an asset. From there, I took on progressively more
							technical roles, including mobile development and data engineering, and I found that I had a
							natural knack for picking up new technologies and languages. My experience has taught me
							that being a fast learner isn't just about raw intelligence or aptitude, but rather a
							mindset of curiosity, adaptability, and a willingness to learn from others. It's this
							mindset that has allowed me to thrive in an industry that is constantly evolving, and that I
							seek to cultivate in others as well.</p>

							<h2>I am a Communicator</h2>
						</header>
						<p>As a leader, my most important responsibility is to serve as the
							"communicator-in-chief" for the people I lead. I work hard to distill our vision,
							mission,
							and values into an easy-to-understand paradigm that resonates with everyone. This way,
							our
							goals are clear and ingrained in our culture. I aim to embody Seth Godin's
							definition of culture: 'people like us do things like this...' and to influence the things
							people like us do.</p>
						<p>I am constantly seeking different ways to emphasize our message and
							principles, to the point that my teams roll their eyes when they ask a question that
							could
							be answered from our values. Effective communication is a two-way street, which is why I
							actively listen and seek feedback from my teams. By fostering a culture of open and
							honest
							communication, we can work together to achieve our shared goals and build a strong and
							vibrant organization.</p>

							<h2>I am a Technologist</h2>
						</header>
						<p>Technology has been a lifelong passion of mine. From the early days of tinkering with my
							Vendex computer and upgrading the memory in my Pentium system, to getting my hands on my
							first cell phone, a Nokia 5190, or buying my first Android smartphone, I've been fascinated
							by the
							transformative power of technology. As I delved deeper into the field, I found myself
							drawn to emerging technologies like 3D printing, machine learning, blockchain, and, most
							recently, ChatGPT. I am
							constantly seeking out new opportunities to learn and grow, both personally and
							professionally.</p>
						<p>For me, technology is more than just a tool. It's an incredible force for change, with
							the power to shape the future in ways we can't even imagine. I am passionate about
							exploring the potential of new technologies and working to apply them in meaningful ways
							that can make a positive impact on people's lives.</p>
						<p>As a technologist, I am driven by a sense of curiosity and a desire to innovate. I am
							always looking for ways to push the boundaries of what's possible and create new
							solutions to complex problems. With every project I undertake, I bring a deep level of
							expertise and a commitment to excellence that ensures success. Whether it's developing
							cutting-edge software, exploring new technologies, or collaborating with others to
							create something truly amazing, I am always excited to be a part of what's next.</p>
